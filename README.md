idk why and when i give it such a name...

It's a diffusion model for language, but i used multidenoiser.

It doesn't works very very well, but already out of my exceptation.

Recently, I use my poor 1650 trained it for about 8mins, and got a min loss of about 0.07

Thus, it can produce some abstract words, but still need to be improved, or scaled?

So, just Enjoy it.

(My poor English...)

thanks chatGPT-4o, it's powerful.
